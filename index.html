  <p> <strong><a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Special:Search/farmer">Farmer</a></strong> <em>(also called an agriculturer[citation needed])</em> is a person engaged in agriculture, raising living organisms for food or raw materials. The term usually applies to people who do some combination of raising field crops, orchards, vineyards, poultry, or other livestock. A farmer might own the farmed land or might work as a laborer on land owned by others, but in advanced economies, a farmer is usually a farm owner, while employees of the farm are known as farm workers, or farmhands. However, in the not so distant past, a farmer was a person who promotes or improves the growth of <em>(a plant, crop, etc.)</em> by labor and attention, land or crops or raises animals <em>(as livestock or fish)</em>.</p>

  <br><h3>Income</h3><hr>
  <p>Farmed products might be sold either to a market, in a farmers' market, or directly from a farm. In a subsistence economy, farm products might to some extent be either consumed by the farmer's family or pooled by the community.
